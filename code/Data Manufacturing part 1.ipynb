    "### Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficient Market Hypothesis proposed by Fama [1965] states that stock market prices are driven by all observable information. In reality, it has been shown that investor sentiment can affect the asset prices due to the well-known psychological fact that investors with positive (negative) sentiment tend to make overly optimistic(pessimistic) judgments and decisions [Keynes, 1937]\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence the purpose of this notebook is to check if the above hypthesis holds true and if the news sentiment can indeed affect the Volatilty price index and to what extent."
