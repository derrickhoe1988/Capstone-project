    "Although it did not achieve an accuracy (i.e. 68.2%) higher than the baseline accuracy of 94.8% (extremely high due to imbalanced data), this is still a much better model because the baseline model will also never predict that a location has West Nile Virus, which may lead to outbreaks of the disease. Besides, we observe minimal overfitting of the model when comparing both the accuracy and AUC scores of the training and validation datasets.\n",
